# Lumi Playground

This is my personal digital playground! I try out different ideas, practise different tools and generally just play around with different digital tools and services.

There will be broken stuff. That's the point of trying out new things!

(Currently) this is built with SvelteKit. Possibly subject to change!

## Installing

Why would you want to do this? Well, for the curious ones.

1. Clone this project
2. Run `npm install` or whatevery tool you like.
3. Run `npm dev -- --open`
4. Tada, you're now live on http://localhost:5173/
